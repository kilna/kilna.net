Kilna is co-CEO of Deck n Roll, along with Rob Prom. Deck n Roll is developing
both tabletop and online / mobile card-games, most importantly the new Deck64
playing card system.  

Deck64 is a 64-card deck designed around three independent attributes: rank,
suit, and color. Unlike a standard 52-card deck where color is tied to suit (e.g.
red/black), in Deck64 color is separate, with four colors, four suits, and four ranks (1-4), for a total of 4×4×4 = 64 distinct cards. Games include Avalanche,
a game in which players try to empty their hands by discarding cards that match
the previously played card on two attributes (rank & suit, suit & color, or
color & rank), potentially discarding several cards in sequence (“an avalanche”).
