The 48 Hour Film Project is a film-making competition and festival held in over
a hundred cities around the globe. Teams create a complete short film in just
one weekend, from writing to final edit.

Each year, dozens of teams (sometimes over a hundred) compete in San Diego.
Films are premiered in a real movie theater with red carpet photo opportunities,
and can advance to an Oscars-style gala showing and awards ceremony.

Kilna is the city producer of the San Diego 48 Hour Film Project, along with
his wife Chrissy Raven Kilna, under the corporate name Cine Diego LLC.
